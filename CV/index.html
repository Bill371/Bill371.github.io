<h1>Personal Statement</h1>
<p>
  Highly motivated individual with an analytical mindset and a passion for all fields of motorsport.
  Possessing a strong foundation in coding and mathematics plus ten years of Motocross racing
  experience across North America where I developed hands on experience in racing strategy, equipment
  maintenance, and testing new bike setups. To build on my Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics
  and further my passion for motorsports I am currently studying a Master of Science in Advanced
  Motorsport Engineering at Cranfield University.
