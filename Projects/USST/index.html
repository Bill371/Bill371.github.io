<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://usst.ca/">University of Saskatchewan Space Team</a> (USST) is a student run engineering 
  group based at the University of Saskatchewan with a focus on space related projects. Between 2015 and 2019 I was involved 
  in the rover project as a mechanical engineer working on the wheel treads, chassis, and suspension 
  systems.  The goal was to make a “Martian” style rover to compete in the 
  <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/">University Rover Challenge</a> 
  and the <a href="https://circ.cstag.ca/">Canadian International Rover Challenge</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Wheel Treads</h2>
<p>
  Custom wheel treads where created using a combination of urethane, carbon fibre, and Kevlar string. 
  The carbon fibre and Kevlar provided bending stiffness and tensional strength while the urethane held 
  the mixture together. Each tread was manufactured by hand using a custom fibre glass mould.
