<h2>Over View</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://usst.ca/">University of Saskatchewan Space Team</a> (USST) is a student run engineering 
  group based at the University of Saskatchewan with a focus on space related projects. Between 2015 and 2019 I was involved 
  in the rover project as a mechanical engineer working on the wheel treads, chassis, and suspension 
  systems.  The goal was to make a “Martian” style rover to compete in the 
  <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/">University Rover Challenge</a> 
  and the <a href="https://circ.cstag.ca/">Canadian International Rover Challenge</a>. </p>
