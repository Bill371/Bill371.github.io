<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://usst.ca/">University of Saskatchewan Space Team</a> (USST) is a student run engineering 
  group based at the University of Saskatchewan with a focus on space related projects. Between 2015 and 2019 I was involved 
  in the rover project as a mechanical engineer working on the wheel treads, chassis, and suspension 
  systems. The project goal was to make a “Martian” style rover to compete in the 
  <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/">University Rover Challenge</a> 
  and the <a href="https://circ.cstag.ca/">Canadian International Rover Challenge</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Wheel Treads</h2>
<p>
  Custom wheel treads were created using a combination of urethane, carbon fibre, and Kevlar string. 
  The carbon fibre and Kevlar provided bending stiffness and tensional strength while the urethane held 
  the mixture together. Each tread was manufactured by hand using a custom fibre glass mould.

<h2>Chassis and Suspension</h2>
<p>
  During my third year on the team I led the design and assembly of a new rover chassis and suspension system 
  with the goal of increasing the space inside for electrical components and stability of the rover while driving. 
  The process involved creating a 1/3 scale prototype of the suspension system. Then moving onto a full-scale 
  prototype where we could test the dynamics of the suspension while turning. The chassis was created using square 
  carbon fibre tubes constructing the large rectangular framework. The suspension system used hand laid carbon fibre 
  to fabricate the suspension arches and suspension arms connected to the chassis. The moulds were designed using a 
  combination of 3D printing and laser cut MDF.
