<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><B> This project is currently on-going</B></p>
<p>
  The project is to create a low cost, low carbon race vehicle to start a new race series 
  based in the Middle East. The Westfield Sport 250 is the foundation for design and 
  and to be further upgraded by my design team to a hybrid powertrain system. Modifications
  to the engine will allow for operation on hydrogen fuel, powering the rear wheels,
  while the front wheels can be used to recover electrical energy which can later be deployed 
  to provide a boost to performance. Plans to run a series of vehicle dynamics and thermal 
  experiments over the course of the project have been cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. 
  In replacment of the tests work will be verified through literature and additional simulations.

<h2>MATLAB Hybrid Thermal Model</h2>
<p>
  I have spearheaded the development of a thermal simulation model in MATLAB for the electrical powertrain system 
  with a large focus on the battery pack. Using a combination of models found in literature 
  I developed a simulation capable of modelling the temperature of the individual battery 
  cells core and surface, as well as the heat transferred to air flowing through the battery 
  pack housing. Simulation of the temperature of each cell individually aids in providing a 
  complete view of how heat is generated and transferred within the battery. Battery cells 
  performace veries greatly with temperature and typically have an opertation temperature no greater 
  than 60 degrees centigrade. Through the simulations I can show our system keeps all battery cells
  under the temperature limit and at peak performance.
  The heat transfer model was integrated with an existing MATLAB vehicle dynamics model, 
  created by team member, allowing simulation of the thermal management system in conjunction to 
  simulated duty cycles of the hybrid system and airflow across the hybrid components.
