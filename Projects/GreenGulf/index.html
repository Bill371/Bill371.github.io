<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The task was to create a low cost, low carbon race vehicle for a new race series 
  based in the Middle East. The Westfield Sport 250 is used as the base and upgraded 
  to a hybrid powertrain system. The engine is modified to run on hydrogen fuel 
  while the front wheels can be used to recover and deploy electrical energy. There 
  was plans to run a series of vehicle dynamics and thermal experiments over the course 
  of the project. However due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 these were cancelled 
  pushing more work to be verified through literature and simulations.

<h2>MATLAB Hybrid Thermal Model</h2>
<p>
  I developed a thermal simulation model in MATLAB for the electrical powertrain system 
  with a large focus on the battery pack. Using a combination of models found in literature 
  I created a simulation capable of modelling the temperature of the individual battery 
  cells core and surface, as well as the heat transferred to air blowing through the battery 
  pack. This allowed simulation of the temperature of each cell individually providing a 
  complete view of how heat is generated and transferred within the battery. The model was 
  integrated with a MATLAB vehicle dynamics model created by another student, allowing 
  simulation of the thermal management system in conjunction to simulated duty cycles of 
  the hybrid system and airflow across the hybrid components.
